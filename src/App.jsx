/*================================================================
 This version will discuss React contolled components:
   1. HTML elements come with their internal state which is not coupled to React
   2. While we provide essential attributes like id and type in addition to a 
      handler (here: onChange), we do not tell the element its value
   3. Let's use "React" as initial state in the useState declaration line 37 instead of empty string
   4. While the stories have been filtered respectively to the new initial searchTerm,
      the HTML input field doesn't show the value in the browser. 
      Only when we start typing into the input field do we see the changes 
      reflected in it. That's because the input field doesn't know anything about 
      React's state (here: searchTerm), it only uses its handler to communicate 
      (see handleSearch()) its internal state to React state. 

    5. Solution let's pass another prop to Search component - search={searchTerm} 
        <Search search={searchTerm} onSearch={handleSearch}/>

 //business logic. Otherwise retain the {} and put a "return" statement

       //this is the callback handler. It receives the value that was passed by the 
       //Search component whenever the user types something in the Search component.

       //is passed to this callback handler

      //select the record from the list based on the filter
      //Here, the JavaScript array's built-in filter method is used 
      //to create a new filtered array. The filter() method takes a function 
      //as an argument, which accesses each item in the array and returns /
      //true or false. If the function returns true, meaning the condition is 
      //met, the item stays in the newly created array; if the function 
      //returns false, it's removed from the filtered array.

      // const searchedStories = stories.filter(function (story){

 //Within the map() method, we have access to each object and its properties.

 //useState
 //By using useState, we are telling React that we want to have a 
 //stateful value which changes over time. And whenever this stateful value 
 //changes, the affected components (here: Search component) 
 //will re-render to use it (here: to display the recent value).
